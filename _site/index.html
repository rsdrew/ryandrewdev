    <p class="pAbout">My name is Ryan Drew. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in, you guessed it, Computer Science.
        </p>
    <p class="pAbout">
        I'm currently employed as a full-stack software developer at McCreadieGroup Inc., a business local to the Ann Arbor area that hosts websites for the research of investigational drugs.
    </p>
    <p class="pAbout">
        However, I am also open to freelance work during my off-hours. Take a look at the projects I've worked on below, and reach out if you'd like me to make a website for you!

            <p class="projectAbout">This site was made using Wix.com, a drag-and-drop website builder. Although it never ended up going live, it was a project I had worked on to learn more about Wix. Wix makes it easier for clients to make small edits to their site long after it has been created without the need of the original developer.</p>
